In the first week of June, we concluded the 2024 DataScience@UL-FRI Project Competition. Again, a big thank you to everyone who was a part of this competition, from students to faculty and industry advisors. A special mention goes to our sponsors: CREAPRO, In516ht, Medius, Outbrain, PC7, Siemens and ZCAM. There would be no competition without you!

The competition started in January 2024 with student applications, this year around, we accepted 19 out of 27 teams. The competition then ran for 5 months and saw our competitors work on 18 different project topics based on either practical problems from our colleagues in the industry or more academic problems proposed by us. Just like in previous years, most groups produced really high quality results. Even though most of solutions were on a high level, there were a couple that stood out from the rest. This year’s awardess are:

The best undergraduate team award went to Nejc Hočevar, Matej Kralj, Luka Stražišar for their project Stock optimization of materials (CREAPRO).

The best non data science team award went to Matic Conradi, Rok Mokotar, Jan Rojc for their project Large and deep models for anomaly detection (Medius).
