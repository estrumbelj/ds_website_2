__What?__

__A new and improved traffic model for Slovenia - leveraging mobile positioning data__  by Leon Hvastja (Data scientist, Medius)

*Are we able to replace classic survey-based traffic models using mobile data? Mobile telecommunication logs generate vast datasets on user positions, offering a powerful resource for modeling daily movement patterns. However, effectively harnessing this data presents significant challenges, including complex noise reduction, the absence of a ground truth for validation, and the need for computationally efficient algorithms to handle the sheer volume of data.*

__Lessons from Real-World Automated Grading and Simulation Systems__ by Frenk Dragar  (Founder, Trivial Group)

*In this talk, we’ll explore practical lessons from deploying automated grading and simulation systems in real-world educational settings. How do grader bias, incomplete data, and student feedback shape our system development? How to make automated feedback not only accurate and scalable, but also constructive and fair? We’ll share insights from production-ready interactive learning experiences.*

__AI Real-Time Feedback in Sports__ by Maja Kolar (Data scientist, Valira)

*Traditional gym training lacks immediate, objective feedback on exercise technique and performance. We developed a real-time computer vision system that tracks multiple athletes simultaneously, automatically recognizes exercises, counts repetitions, and provides instant technique corrections during workouts. In this talk, we will present the core challenges of building the end-to-end pipeline while maintaining real-time performance on live video streams.*

__In-house Tooling__ by Luka Androjna (Head of Data Science, Aurion11)

*A quick primer on what in-house tooling is, with a focus on: - Why it's good to have in-house developed tooling. - When and how to decide to invest in it. - How to develop it and maintain it. - How to get buy-in from others and spread its use.*

__Emotional intelligence vs gender and academic success__ by Stefan Popov (Senior Data Scientist, Sportradar)

*Is one gender more emotionally intelligent that the other? Does higher emotional intelligence lead to better (or worse) grades? In this talk, we present a research effort that examines the relationship between emotional intelligence, gender, and average grade. We sent out a survey to 45 students, and analysed the results. We present the motivation for our research, the methodology, results, and conclusions.*
