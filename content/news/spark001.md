__What?__

__LLMDataForge: Framework that Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to Generate High-quality Datasets Tailored to Your Needs__  by Gal Petkovšek (Data Scientist at Medius) and Tadej Justin (Chief Data Scientist at Medius)  

*This talk explores generating high-quality synthetic datasets using LLMs, utilising the LLMDataForge framework for filtering and prompt adjustments to enhance training smaller models for NLP tasks.*  

__One Transformation to Rule Them All: Automated Search for Feature Transformations at Scale__ by Mark Žnidar (Data Science Intern at Outbrain)  

*Automated feature search for field-aware factorization models, generating and evaluating many interactions. This method boosts efficiency and accuracy, enabling scalable, robust AutoML model search.*  

__Generating Synthetic Relational Data__ by Valter Hudovernik (Data Science Student at FRI)  

*An introduction to the emerging field of relational data generation, focusing on the strengths and limitations of current methods in preserving the characteristics of the original datasets.*  

__Weighing in on Evaluating LLM System Performance__ by Greta Gašparac (Data Scientist at Sportradar)  

*Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a surge of interest in various LLM-powered solutions across industries. However, discussions on evaluating these systems deserve equal, if not greater, attention. In this talk, we explore the critical aspects of LLM system evaluation through a practical example of developing a customer support AI assistant.*  

__Next-Generation AI for Intelligent Waste Management: Leveraging LLMOps and Semantic Entity Linking__ by dr. Stevanče Nikoloski (Head of Data & AI at Result)  

*We present a next-gen intelligent waste management solution powered by AI, focusing on semantic entity linking. Using LLMOps, we enhance data collection and fine-tune our LLMs (Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2, Falcon), ensuring local infrastructure compatibility and data privacy. The architecture integrates vector databases with advanced chunking (map-reduce, refine) for applications like summarization, chatbots, and entity linking, enabling continuous improvement and adaptability in waste management.*  

__Value-Based Conversion Tracking in Online Controlled Experiments: Frequentist vs. Bayesian Approach__ by Aljiša Vodopija (Data Scientist at Outbrain)  

*This talk explores value-based conversion tracking in online controlled experiments, contrasting frequentist and Bayesian approaches to optimize revenue from differently valued conversions.*
