The competition started in Jan 2023, it ran for 6 months and saw 19 teams work on 12 different project topics based on practical problems from our colleagues in the industry. Just like in previous years, most groups produced really high quality results. Even though most of solutions were on a high level, there were a couple that stood out from the rest.
