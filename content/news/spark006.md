__What?__

__Sunsei: 5-Day Solar Forecasts, Powered by a Novel Regional AI Model - NWPsolarNet__  
by Marko Rus (Data Scientist, Medius)  

*NWPsolarNet revolutionizes solar forecasting, moving beyond localized, data-intensive methods. This innovative model, trained on over 300 diverse sites, provides accurate 5-day forecasts for virtually any location, currently focused on Slovenia, without needing historical site-specific data. We'll detail NWPsolarNet's technical aspects and introduce Sunsei, a public tool offering powerful forecasting for solar energy optimization.*  

__Dynamic Line Rating in the Electric Power Grid and the Data Science Challenges at Operato__  
by Frank Amand (CTO, Operato)  

*What is dynamic line rating and ampacity? Where can data science and ML help us: calculating average/aggregate grid capacity gains, quantifying and reducing uncertainty and operational risk. We'll also discuss open challenges and opportunities for a Bayesian approach.*  

__Building Secure MCP Infrastructure: From Auto-Generation to Enterprise Hosting__  
by Luka Gačnik (Software Engineer, Endava)  

*Model Context Protocol (MCP) is revolutionizing how AI agents interact with tools and data sources. This talk demonstrates MCP Blacksmith, a platform that auto-generates production-ready MCP servers from OpenAPI specifications with built-in authentication and observability. We also preview a hosting platform designed to solve MCP's security and deployment challenges at scale, enabling data science teams to safely deploy agentic applications with enterprise-grade infrastructure.*  

__Evaluations in the World of Agents__  
by Jan Hartman (Machine Learning Engineer, Sourcegraph)  

*As practitioners in data science and machine learning, we're trained to evaluate every change we make. From offline loss metrics to online A/B tests, we measure everything to ensure data-driven decisions. In the world of AI and agents, however, both input and output spaces are effectively infinite. This talk discusses what this means and presents learnings from hands-on work on agentic systems.*
