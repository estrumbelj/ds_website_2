### Data science Project competition
------

The DataScience@UL-FRI Project Competition is an annual competition whose main goal is to connect students, academics, and industry. Over the course of a semester teams of students work on real-world data science problems guided by co-supervisors from academia and industry. The best teams are invited to present their work at the competition finals. The competition allows companies to showcase their challenges to academics and gives students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a structured but fun way.
